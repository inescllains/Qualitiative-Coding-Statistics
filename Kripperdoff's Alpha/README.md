# Krippendorff's Alpha

Calculates inter-coder reliability using Pyhton's Krippendorff's Alpha and Pandas DataFrame. 
This can be used to calculate the reliability in the nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio metric, and can be used for two or more coders with missing values. 

## How to use

Firstly you need to create csv files for each coder individually and then simply change the name in the csv file section of the document to create the DataFrames that will then be used. 
To add coders simply create more DataFrames, and add them to the rest of the code.
